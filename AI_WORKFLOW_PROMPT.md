## Questions to Address in Workflow Design

1. How can we optimize the AI interaction patterns to provide maximum value to users?
2. What are the most efficient ways to handle real-time updates and notifications?
3. How should we structure the workflow for handling large file uploads and processing?
4. What's the best approach for managing user permissions and access control?
5. How can we implement effective error recovery and user guidance workflows?
6. What monitoring and analytics workflows should be built into the system?
7. How should we handle system scaling as user base grows?

Please provide comprehensive workflow designs that consider both current functionality and future scalability requirements. Focus on creating efficient, user-friendly, and maintainable processes that leverage the AI capabilities effectively.
